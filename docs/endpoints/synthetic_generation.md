Represents the parameters used for configuring search queries, including
query builder, subgraph, and predicate options. 

This class is designed to support both the `IN`, `<` and `=` statements in
query generation.

This endpoint generates batches of queries, for each batch one value of each
attribute is sampled. Attributes that are a list mean that batches will
exhaustively search over all the values in the list. For example, if
`max_hops = [2, 3]` and `keep_edge_probability = [0.5, 0.7]`, then 4 batches
will be generated.

Termination conditions: We ran all possible batches, generating for each batch
up to `max_signatures_per_fact_table` signatures per fact table, and for
each signature up to `max_queries_per_signature` queries.
# Attributes
- dataset (Dataset): The dataset to be used (TPCDS, TPCH).
- duckdb_database (str): The path to the DuckDB database file.
- output_folder (str): The folder to save the generated queries.

- unique_joins (bool): Whether to enforce unique joins in the subgraph.
- max_signatures_per_fact_table (int): Maximum number of signatures per
    signature. This means that for each fact table we will generate this 
    number of unique join structures/ signatures.
- max_queries_per_signature (int): Maximum number of queries per signature
generated by varying the predicates.
- max_hops (list[int]): Maximum number of hops allowed in the subgraph.
- keep_edge_probability (float): Probability of retaining an edge in the
    subgraph.

- extra_predicates (list[int]): Number of column predicates, in addition to 
    join predicates to include.
- row_retention_probability (list[float]): Probability of retaining a row
    for range predicates
- operator_weights (PredicateOperatorProbability): Probability
    distribution for predicate operators.
- equality_lower_bound_probability (float): Lower bound probability when
    using the `=` and the `IN` operators
- extra_values_for_in: Extra values to add when using the `IN` operator. For
IN we take a value of the most common values and add a number of extra
values to it. This parameter defines how many extra values to add.


- operator_weights: The weights are used to sample the operator for each
    predicate. The weights do not need to sum up to 1, they will be
    normalized automatically. The higher the weight, the more likely the
    operator will be used.
    - operator_in : Weight for the `IN` operator.
    - operator_equals : Weight for the `=` operator.
    - operator_range : Weight for the `<` , `>` operator.
